# Eloquent JS

## Learning Goals

Master the basics of the Javascript language.

## Introduction

The book [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) is available online. There are 21 chapters, of which 5 are projects. Assuming that some of the book will be review, completing the whole book (projects and all) should take 6-10 focused hours.

You can tackle the book in chunks. Set time on your calendar, with events named something like 'EJS: Chapter 1-2'. Work your way from the beginning to the end. Do not skip the exercises! Even if they appear simple, they help you know for sure that you have actually learned the material in each chapter, not just skimmed.
